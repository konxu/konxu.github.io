      <h1 style="color: #127067">To Stay or Not?</h1>
          <h3>I always <span style="background-color:#127067">accept all the answers</span> in my life <span style="font-size: .7em;">(I think it is mainly because I believe in myself that
          <span style="background-color:#127067">I can always fix it</span> in some ways)</span>,
          but sometimes <span style="background-color:#127067">life forces us to make decisions</span> <span style="font-size: .7em;">(and I totally understand that in Asian culture, we are not living for only ourselves)</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>After graduation, though we all have the chance of getting two more years with a graduation visa <span style="font-size: .7em;">(full working condition)</span>,
          most of my Chinese classmates went back to China - so <span style="background-color:#127067">we were left because we did not leave</span>.
          The main reason is that many international students from our program cannot get a proper job in these years
          <span style="font-size: .7em;">(we do not even have a networking system for getting more information about that)</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>So my attitude about that was not very clear - <span style="background-color:#127067">it’s like gambling</span> and I struggled a lot <span style="font-size: .7em;">(including asked a career advisor from RMIT for help)</span>.
          Staying for another two years is fine for me, going back to China is also fine for me. I thought this attitude might not bother me too much, but things
          changed until I received my dad’s messages...
          </h3>
          <h3>My dad told me there is a chance for me to become a teacher back in my hometown. With a background of study overseas, it would be easier for
          me to get into the system. Compared with <span style="background-color:#127067">the high cost of living abroad alone and the limited hope of getting a job here</span>, working back in my hometown
          seems like a good choice.
          </h3>
          <h3>However, the first thing that came to my mind was <span style="background-color:#127067">“no”</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>There are two reasons for that. One is that I cannot take responsibility for the students. It is unfair for the students
          who need to step into the industry after graduation get a teacher without working experience - <span style="background-color:#127067">
            Nobody deserves it</span> <span style="font-size: .7em;">(though today not many teachers
          think in that way in my hometown, sad!)</span>. Another reason is that I feel doubt going back that fast.
          </h3>
          <h3>I called my friend Rubin, I don’t know why I called him, but I did. As a person who has a similar background, he might understand me more.
          </h3>
          <h3>He said it is kind of obvious that <span style="background-color:#127067">you already know your answer</span> <span style="font-size: .7em;">(yes, I find out that most of the times, people always have the answer in
          mind when asking for help)</span>. Then our conversation came to the direction about how to tell that decision to my parents.
          </h3>
          <h3>But surprisingly, I <span style="background-color:#127067">made the decision very fast</span>
           - that is mainly because I know the answer and this thing just <span style="background-color:#127067">pushed me to have a stronger
          attitude</span>. Most of the time, the attitude of accepting everything saves me from different situations, but sometimes, a stronger attitude helps me
          to <span style="background-color:#127067">have a clear mind about future direction and also get to know myself better</span> <span style="font-size: .7em;">(like what I want, what I care and what I value)</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>Another surprising thing happened. <span style="background-color:#127067">My parents accepted that decision fast as well</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>Yes, it is a good chance to go back, but choosing that also means saying no to many other opportunities -
          <span style="background-color:#127067">my dream is in space</span>, not in the university.</h3>
          <h3>My dad said when he heard that, he knew, I will stay and can stay.</h3>
          <h3>I now <span style="background-color:#127067">have a stronger willingness</span> to have working experience here and <span style="background-color:#127067">I will fight for it</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>As Amiel said, you should stay because <span style="background-color:#127067">you have so many things to do here</span> <span style="font-size: .7em;">(Oh, you ask me who Amiel is? Ha, he is a funny guy I met because I stayed,
          I will get back to him later)</span>.
          </h3>
          <h3>Anyway, my parents would be a little bit bothered by my decision - they need to explain that to my other families.
          Yes, I sometimes doubted if this is my life or not.
          </h3>
          <h3>But not from <span style="background-color:#127067">now</span>.<br>
