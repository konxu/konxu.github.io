  <h1 style="font-size: 48px;color:#679866; padding-top: 50px">Have a taste of the industry</h1>
  <img src="images/mar2.gif" style="width: 50%">
  <p style="color:#679866;">I am so lucky that I <span style="background-color:pink">have many friends around</span>, some of them are new to the industry (like me),
    some of them are with more experience.
    <br><br>Duan is one of my friends that already worked in the industry for years, especially in the
    advertising field. We got to know each other because of the project <a style="color:#679866; background-color: #679866" href="https://xyxy.space/ProgramRecords.html" target="_blank">Program Records</a> <span style="font-size: .7em">(that was my second
    project at RMIT, I danced on the presentation day, so many people got to know me)</span>.
    Duan was interested in my thinking process and our conversation began from that.
    <br><br>Because I am so new to the real creative world, so he is naturally my go-to when I have
    questions <span style="font-size: .7em">(that I am always with)</span>. I sometimes can feel that I am slowly "dragged" to the advertising
    world <span style="font-size: .7em">(I prefer saying that he saw some shining points in me that are suitable for the industry)</span>.
    However, I still had no ideas about what is it like, in real.
    <br><br>One day, he asked me, we have a shooting day, do you want to come？
    <br><br>Absolutely yes <span style="font-size: .7em">(I am always <span style="background-color:pink">a yes person</span>, as you can see)</span>.
    <br><br>It was for promoting a Chinese restaurant in Melbourne to the local audience,
    so Duan's team chose to take a series of short films for cinemas.
    <br><br>Before the <span style="font-size: .7em">(big)</span> day, I helped to prepare the shoes for the models <span style="font-size: .7em">(and learned that you always
    need a plan B)</span>. Doing this kind of jobs, it needs help from all the people involved, and you know,
    when you have more hands, sometimes things can be more complicated.
    <br><br>However, that also brought the perfect chance for me to <span style="background-color:pink">
      learn from everyone</span> <span style="font-size: .7em">(and at this point,
    I am so open to get connected. Another thing that I am interested in is
    diffferent ways and attitudes to life - I am curious about the potential of living)</span>.
    For the whole day, I kept asking questions,
    not only to Duan but also to models, makeup artists and other staff in the group.
    <br><br>Because my main task was to make sure all the models can be set on time so I communicated with the models a lot.
    That included talking with a hipster that has many holes in body but wear clothes with sharp rivets, a
    Chinese boy that applied a one-year holiday working visa to be the walk-on here <span style="font-size: .7em">(heard lots of stories
    about choosing this career from him)</span>, a passionate biracial beauty that likes singing and dancing
    <span style="font-size: .7em">(talked a little bit about belonging)</span>... Besides that, I also took photos to record the day. I also
    found the interest in the video shooting <span style="font-size: .7em">(but do not want to explore more about that at this stage)</span>.
    Preparing all the materials for the shooting was also a complicated process <span style="font-size: .7em">(I feel so pity for the food
    that cannot be eaten at the end)</span>.
    <br><br>In the plan, there were some martial arts included, however, the actor had no ideas about it.
    Luckily we had the cameraman who had experience with it and he directed the actor a lot. However,
    there is a specific part that needs to think of five different actions. It is not easy to think of
    enough ideas alone, so I provided some options and one of them was selected to be used <span style="font-size: .7em">(I learned many
    strange things along the journey and sometimes it works)</span>. That was
    <span style="background-color:pink">my shining moment</span>.
<br><br>Generally, it was a crazy day for me to get a taste of the industry and the best thing was that
<span style="background-color:pink">I found out myself enjoying it</span>. I cannot say that this field
would definitely my thing (because it was just one bite),
but I am <span style="background-color:pink">happy and willing to explore more</span> in that direction.
<br><br>For me, the process is like tasting different kinds of food in the shop, and I would say
that I like this one or/and that one.
<br><br>But overall, I really like food <span style="font-size: .7em">(design)</span>.
<br><br>And I eat <span style="font-size: .7em">(design)</span> a lot.
<br><br>And <span style="background-color:pink">I am hungry to learn</span> <span style="font-size: .7em">(you know, design)</span>.
    <br><br><hr>Shhhhhhhh... I found myself <a href="mar3.html"><span style="background-color:#679866; color: black">become boring</a>.

      <h1>Keep being creative!</h1>
      <h3>So many people told me this after talking with me.
        <br><br>Yes, it is a process <span style="background-color:febz">full of challenges and opportunities</span>.
        It is so exciting because we are so new and fresh. We <span style="background-color:febz">have so many possibilities</span>
        though it is so easy to doubt a lot about ourselves.
      <br><br>“Do not try to work in the suite, you just cannot do it”, Elliott said.
      I think it is because <span style="background-color:febz">we were born with creativity</span> and <span style="background-color:febz">we live for creativity</span>.
    <br><br>If you are the same kind of person, <span style="background-color:febz">keep being creative</span> and <span style="background-color:febz">do not give up</span>.</h3>
