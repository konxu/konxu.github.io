        <h3>
        Not very long ago, my resume, website, emails, and even LinkedIn were all started with “she”.
        It was not because I am feminism or I want to emphasize about my gender.
        It was simply because I am shy and I have a special name.
          <br><br><span style="background-color:#127067">It is a personal choice to have an English name</span> but many people encouraged me to think about it
           - my name is quite hard for many people <span style="font-size: .7em">(and that is not my fault)</span>.
           I understand that <span style="background-color:#127067">more opportunities might come when other people can easily pronounce
             in their language</span>.
           But a random name does not make sense to me, so I used the initial characters of my name, “x” and “y”.
           I repeated it once - otherwise, it is way too short.
          <br><br>The new name gave me the idea of building the whole concept of my brand. “x” and “y” makes a dot <span style="font-size: .7em">(x, y)</span>.
          I see my self as a dot, and everyone/everything around is a dot. <span style="background-color:#127067">My passion is using design to build connections,
          and my mission is using design to build meaningful connections</span>. Yes, I am sure that I am gonna use this name now.
          <br><br>Besides “she” the word and the name, I also used striking lines to build my system. I like how it works
          with my words, striking on the words for fun - people always pay attention to those jokes because of the form
          <span style="font-size: .7em">(kind of match what I want - I am crazy about something fun)</span>.
          <br><br>So as you can see, I hid behind “she” and the striking lines for a long time. But since I decided to be
          braver, it's time to make some changes.  I turned “she” to “I”  <span style="font-size: .7em">(It is so strange at the beginning but now I
          already get used to it)</span>. I also turned the striking lines into highlights, so that I choose to jump out instead of hiding.
          <br><br>
          There is an important suggestion to tell if you have a similar idea of changing the system - I <span style="background-color:#127067">encourage you to do that as
          early as possible</span>. Because I decided to change after printing 200 name cards, and it took me a long time to turn in the new system.
          <br><br><img src="img/three-5.jpg" style="width:90%; border: 20px solid #127067;">
          <br><br><span style="background-color:#127067">The new system made me more confident about myself</span> but that does not mean that I have no connection with the elements in the
          old system. When Cally suggested me to have an actual pronunciation of my name, I choose the one that was first called by Elliott,
          “she-she”.
