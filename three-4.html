        Elliott is the first one that said yes to my coffee chat invitation this year.
          <br><br>It was not my first time doing the coffee chat. Last year, my teacher Suzie introduced me
          to do one with Hope, a graphic designer that time worked in a service design company, then changed
          back to be a graphic designer now. I still remember that time I was shaking, with no ideas about
          how to talk and what to talk about. And the coffee was too bitter to drink <span style="font-size: .7em">(I really cannot
          drink coffee)</span>.
          <br><br>So this time, I began to think about it even when I started my research on choosing the
          people to send the invitation. Elliott came to my mind was first because he works as an art
          director in an advertising company, secondly was his background, he studied fine art before.
          I was very curious about how he turned his art career into the advertising industry. After
          <a style="color: #127067" href="three-3.html" target="_blank">the “tasting” day</a>, I was quite interested to know more about this area and see if I can be a good fit.
        </h3>
      </div>
          <h3><span style="background-color:#127067">Changing career path from what you learned in the university has become common these days,
          but doing that is not easy</span>.
        </h3>
        <div class="text2">
          <h3>There are still tips of doing that though. Duan introduced me a school
          before, <a style="color: #127067" href="https://awardonline.com/education/award-school">AWARD School</a>, which can be used as a jumping board for people from other backgrounds to get
          into the advertising world <span style="font-size: .7em">(I wanted to apply this year, but missed the time)</span>.
          <br><br>Fortunately, Elliott didn’t need to do it. Besides fine art, he also learned graphic design and kept doing art and graphic design
          before getting into the industry. He got his first job in the Ad world because of his teacher. But he still loves the School and everyone running it.
           It is a great school, and many amazing creatives do it. He encouraged me to apply for that next year and believes it will definitely help my job prospects.
          <br><br>Till today, Elliott still found passion on it, at least part of it. He admitted that it
          is not easy to be in this industry, sometimes you just have to work extra hours for the best results.
          He also recommended me to <span style="background-color:#127067">apply for smaller advertising studios</span>. Because they will be a little bit
          picky on the clients so that I can play with more fun projects. He also <span style="background-color:#127067">encouraged me to think about
          being an in-house and generally applying for everything about design</span> <span style="font-size: .7em">(he also said “do not try to
          work in the suite, you just cannot do it”)</span>.
          <br><br>Being an art director means somehow you need to work closely with a copywriter. He
          encouraged me to <span style="background-color:#127067">find one so that I can have a creative team</span>, but he also said there are
          some cases that people can enter the industry alone.
          <br><br>At the end of our conversation, he had a look at my portfolio. My portfolio is the <a style="color: #127067" href="https://xyxy.space" target="_blank">website</a>,
          so it was quite easy to just show him on the phone. I observed how he interacted with my website,
          which part he noticed the most, which part he spent some time to read, which part he skipped.
          They are all valuable information for me to <span style="background-color:#127067">keep improving the user experience and sell myself better</span>.
          <br><br>After seeing my works in graphic design, Elliott pointed out that some of the projects are more
          interesting and encouraged me to put them first. I thought about doing that before, however, they are
          not completed to me <span style="font-size: .7em">(I do not why I have no interest in perfecting my old projects, maybe I just like
          them when they were done at that time, the imperfect live feelings)</span>. <span style="background-color:#127067">When I learned more along the
          journey, my works become more professional and more completed</span>.
          <br><br>And <span style="background-color:#127067">they become boring in some ways</span>.
          <br><br>There are still nice ideas behind, but it becomes harder to surprise people.
          <br><br>I felt really disappointed at that time. Lots of doubts with myself.
