    <h3>I’ve heard this so many times in the past three months. I hope you’ve heard that a lot as well
    because that means, <span style="background-color:#005d9e">people are helping you</span>.
    <br><br>In 2017, I came to Australia alone <span style="background-color:#005d9e">from China</span> and studied the
    <span style="background-color:#005d9e">Master of Communication Design at RMIT University</span>.
      Besides improving the design skills, I joined many <span style="background-color:#005d9e">voluntary events and challenges</span>. I also got my first (paid) <span style="background-color:#005d9e">intern opportunity</span> in Australia from those events.
      After two years, I <span style="background-color:#005d9e">graduated with Distinction</span>.
    <br><br>Then I was chosen to <span style="background-color:#005d9e">represent the school</span> for Hong Kong Design Week, after that trip, my parents came to visit me for my graduation ceremony.
    We traveled a little bit in Australia and I finally got the chance to go back to China in these two years, for a holiday.
    <br><br>However, when I came back to <span style="background-color:#005d9e">Melbourne</span> in <span style="background-color:#005d9e">January</span> and thought I was ready to work,
    I began to find out that the things become harder than I thought...
    <br><br>This is a <span style="background-color:#005d9e">personal project</span> that recorded my journey for <span style="background-color:#005d9e">finding my first (paid) job in the creative industry (in Australia)</span>.
    Many people do not like talking about this process, even when I ask them directly, most people just use one or two sentences to summarize it.
    Yes, these moments are not that shiny, and sometimes very dark.
    <br><br>But you will know, or probably already know that, though some people are very lucky, for most of us, <span style="background-color:#005d9e">this process contains much more</span>.
    Sometimes it is long, so long, too long - If we see this as a game, <span style="background-color:#005d9e">my mode would definitely be the hard mode</span>, we should admit that.
    <br><br>I feel really grateful that <span style="background-color:#005d9e">so many people helped me</span> in this journey. I do not know how to pay it back but sharing this with more people.
    <br><br>By the way, I am <a href="https://xyxy.space"><span style="background-color:#FFE380;color:#00A9D1">xyxy</span></a> and <span style="background-color:#005d9e">I hope this might help you as well</span>...
