      <h1 style="color: #127067">“If you want money, ask for advice. If you want advice, ask for money.”</h1>
      <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">
        After deciding to stay and keep looking for opportunities here, I need to face reality,
        <span style="background-color:#127067">I barely know the industry</span> and <span style="background-color:#127067">I do not know which direction I want to go further</span>.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">I know I want to do something about creativity, but honestly, I do not mind doing anything,
        branding, book design, service design, illustration... <span style="font-size: .7em">(and I do not even know that soon
        I will explore much broader, into comedy and performance)</span> All the forms do not matter, I just
        want to <span style="background-color:#127067">tell stories to connect more people</span>
        <span style="font-size: .7em">(and that is the main theme for me to build my website)</span>.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">This problem is the whole-time thing that I am focusing on in this project.
        And I actually find out that some people can really have a clear understanding of themselves,
        they know what they want to do and what they can do. Sometimes these two things might not match,
        but people I met always <span style="background-color:#127067">start from what they can do to get to do what they want to do</span> step by step
        - yes, it is a long process and you have the chance to make changes.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">So I began by getting to know the industry. My method is <span style="background-color:#127067">to appear on every
        design-related events that I can find</span>. Because I had the experience as a service designer in Metro
        Trains so I started with events about service design and UX design, and they are reasonably easier to be found.
        <span style="background-color:#127067"><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" style="color:black;">GA</a> and
          <a href="https://academyxi.com/" style="color:black;">Academy Xi</a></span> always have a lot <span style="font-size: .7em">
          (and so many free ones)</span>. <span style="background-color:#127067"><a href="https://thedesignkids.org/" style="color:black;">The Design Kids</a></span> also organized lots
        of good events <span style="font-size: .7em">(though that time,
          I was like “only one lecture a month, too little for me. I need more!!!”)</span>.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">As I said, <span style="background-color:#127067">I am not a social person</span>, and I really do not like events full of people.
        The hardest time for me is to wait till it starts <span style="font-size: .7em">(people around me are talking and I am acting
        like I am busy drinking, god, I do not even drink)</span>. I never ask questions or do further communication.
        I even have to reduce one or two when I feel this week I have too many events
        <span style="font-size: .7em">(luckily, I still remember that I need to <span style="background-color:#127067">take care of myself</span>)</span>.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">But it became better when <span style="background-color:#127067">I met someone familiar</span>. I met my design leader in Metro Trains
        in three lectures. The first time he was one of the speakers and I finally had the courage
        to go and say hello. He still remembers me, which encouraged me a lot. But we did not talk too much and
        that also happened on the second time. On the third time, he asked me what I was busy with. I said I was
        looking for a job and he said he can help.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">He asked me to send him my website and resume, he would have a look and give me feedback. I asked,
          “<span style="background-color:#127067">can I give you my card instead?</span>”
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">He was surprised, but said, “that would be better!”
        </h3>
        <h3 style="line-height: 2rem;">I gave him the business card and I was still very shy, so we quickly said goodbye.
        To be honest, <span style="background-color:#127067">I did not really expect a lot about it</span>
        <span style="font-size: .7em">(so many people said “see you around”,
        and they just left)</span>. I even began to think about how to remind him again after several days.
        </h3>
        <h2 style="line-height: 2rem;font-size: 1.2rem;">But I received the email the next day. And it was morning. And it was really really long.
        <br><br>I nearly screamed. <span style="background-color:#127067">I cried</span>.
        <br><br>
        He gave me feedback about my branding system
        <span style="font-size: .7em">(mostly good words and now I understand more
        about how important to be encouraged)</span>, also talked about how to find a design job. He gave me a saying
        that he was told once which he loves. “<span style="background-color:#127067">If you want money (/job), ask for advice. If you want advice,
        ask for money(/job)</span>.” He probably does not know that I already saw this sentence
        on his lecture, but it became more powerful when <span style="background-color:#127067">he straightly told me</span> that again.
        <br><br>
        He really <span style="background-color:#127067">encouraged me to go out and reach out to people in the industry</span>. Though
        I did not have a huge number of coffee chats, I did some <span style="font-size: .7em">(I thought I would never do that
        even last year)</span> and some of them were really important for me. He also brought out my “honesty”,
        <span style="background-color:#127067">always be honest with myself</span> and <span style="background-color:#127067">ask for help when needed</span>.
        <br><br>
        I really understand that getting used to answering “I am fine, thank you” when someone asks
      “How are you?” or even “Do you need help?”. But this mode of thinking is not stable for me now.
        <br><br>
        The barrier that limited my connections with the world is now falling</span>.
