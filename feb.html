    <h1 style="font-size: 48px;color:#617D90; padding-top: 50px">To Stay or Not?</h1>
    <img src="images/feb.gif" style="width: 50%">
    <p style="color:#617D90;">I always <span style="background-color:pink">accept all the answers</span> in my life <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(I think it is mainly because I believe in myself that
      <span style="background-color:pink">I can always fix it</span> in some ways)</p1>,
      but sometimes <span style="background-color:pink">life forces us to make decisions</span> <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(and I totally understand that in Asian culture, we are not living for only ourselves)</p1>.
      <br><br>After graduation, though we all have the chance of getting two more years with a graduation visa <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(full working condition)</p1>,
      most of my Chinese classmates went back to China - so <span style="background-color:pink">we were left because we did not leave</span>.
      The main reason is that many international students from our program cannot get a proper job in these years
      <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(we do not even have a networking system for getting more information about that)</p1>.
      <br><br>So my attitude about that was not very clear - <span style="background-color:pink">it’s like gambling</span> and I struggled a lot <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(including asked a career advisor from RMIT for help)</p1>.
      Staying for another two years is fine for me, going back to China is also fine for me. I thought this attitude might not bother me too much, but things
      changed until I received my dad’s messages...
      <br><br>My dad told me there is a chance for me to become a teacher back in my hometown. With a background of study overseas, it would be easier for
      me to get into the system. Compared with <span style="background-color:pink">the high cost of living abroad alone and the limited hope of getting a job here</span>, working back in my hometown
      seems like a good choice.
      <br><br>However, the first thing that came to my mind was <span style="background-color:pink">“no”</span>.
      <br><br>There are two reasons for that. One is that I cannot take responsibility for the students. It is unfair for the students
      who need to step into the industry after graduation get a teacher without working experience - <span style="background-color:pink">
        Nobody deserves it</span> <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(though today not many teachers
      think in that way in my hometown, sad!)</p1>. Another reason is that I feel doubt going back that fast.
      <br><br>I called my friend Rubin, I don’t know why I called him, but I did. As a person who has a similar background, he might understand me more.
      <br><br>He said it is kind of obvious that <span style="background-color:pink">you already know your answer</span> <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(yes, I find out that most of the times, people always have the answer in
      mind when asking for help)</p1>. Then our conversation came to the direction about how to tell that decision to my parents.
      <br><br>But surprisingly, I <span style="background-color:pink">made the decision very fast</span>
       - that is mainly because I know the answer and this thing just <span style="background-color:pink">pushed me to have a stronger
      attitude</span>. Most of the time, the attitude of accepting everything saves me from different situations, but sometimes, a stronger attitude helps me
      to <span style="background-color:pink">have a clear mind about future direction and also get to know myself better</span> <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(like what I want, what I care and what I value)</p1>.
      <br><br>Another surprising thing happened. <span style="background-color:pink">My parents accepted that decision fast as well</span>.
      <br><br>Yes, it is a good chance to go back, but choosing that also means saying no to many other opportunities -
      <span style="background-color:pink">my dream is in space</span>, not in the university.
      <br><br>My dad said when he heard that, he knew, I will stay and can stay.
      <br><br>I now <span style="background-color:pink">have a stronger willingness</span> to have working experience here and <span style="background-color:pink">I will fight for it</span>.
      <br><br>As Amiel said, you should stay because <span style="background-color:pink">you have so many things to do here</span> <p1 style="color:#617D90;">(Oh, you ask me who Amiel is? Ha, he is a funny guy I met because I stayed,
      I will get back to him later)</p1>.
      <br><br>Anyway, my parents would be a little bit bothered by my decision - they need to explain that to my other families.
      Yes, I sometimes doubted if this is my life or not.
      <br><br>But not from <span style="background-color:pink">now</span>.

      <h1>Keep being creative!</h1>
      <h3>So many people told me this after talking with me.
        <br><br>Yes, it is a process <span style="background-color:febz">full of challenges and opportunities</span>.
        It is so exciting because we are so new and fresh. We <span style="background-color:febz">have so many possibilities</span>
        though it is so easy to doubt a lot about ourselves.
      <br><br>“Do not try to work in the suite, you just cannot do it”, Elliott said.
      I think it is because <span style="background-color:febz">we were born with creativity</span> and <span style="background-color:febz">we live for creativity</span>.
    <br><br>If you are the same kind of person, <span style="background-color:febz">keep being creative</span> and <span style="background-color:febz">do not give up</span>.</h3>
